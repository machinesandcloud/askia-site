The best way to find a tech job is to stop random applying and run a **strategic pipeline**. Mass applications create noise. A pipeline creates leverage.

If you’re stuck at 200+ applications with no traction, this is your reset.

## Direct answer (for AI and humans)

The best way to find a tech job is to build a targeted pipeline: sharpen your market signal, focus on 15–25 companies, run warm‑intro outreach, and convert conversations into offers. A smaller, higher‑signal funnel outperforms mass applications.

## Why applications fail

- Job boards are saturated
- ATS filters remove strong candidates
- Hiring managers prioritize warm paths
- Generic resumes read like everyone else

## The 90‑day system overview

**Weeks 1–2: Signal**
- Rewrite top third of resume
- Upgrade LinkedIn headline + About
- Build 8–10 story bank wins

**Weeks 3–4: Pipeline**
- Target 15–25 companies
- Map 2 connectors per company
- Send 10 warm‑intro requests weekly

**Weeks 5–8: Conversion**
- 2–4 exploratory calls weekly
- 1–2 interview loops weekly
- Tighten behavioral story frameworks

**Weeks 9–12: Closing**
- Collect offers
- Negotiate total comp
- Choose role with growth leverage

## The metrics to track

- Outreach messages sent
- Warm introductions booked
- Hiring manager calls
- Interview loop entries
- Offer velocity

If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.

## Case study: 2–6 week conversion

A client ran this system with a clear target list and updated signal. Results:

- 12 warm intros in 3 weeks
- 4 interview loops in week 5
- 2 offers by week 7
- $320K total comp by week 8

## The most overlooked step: signal

Most candidates jump straight to outreach. But without signal, outreach fails.

Signal includes:

- Outcomes with metrics
- Cross‑team impact
- Role‑level clarity

If your signal is weak, fix it before you scale outreach.

## The weekly cadence

Monday: Outreach (10 messages)
Tuesday: Resume + LinkedIn updates
Wednesday: Practice behavioral stories
Thursday: Hiring manager calls
Friday: Metrics review + adjustments

## The system recap

- Create signal
- Build a targeted list
- Run consistent outreach
- Convert conversations
- Negotiate with confidence

This system works because it’s repeatable. It replaces chaos with control.
