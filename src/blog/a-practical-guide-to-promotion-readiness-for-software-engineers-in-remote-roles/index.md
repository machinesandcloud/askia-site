If you’re targeting software engineers, promotion readiness should make your impact obvious. This guide gives a clear plan to improve signal and decision clarity.

## Why this matters

Promotion decisions require visible scope and leadership, not just delivery.

## Common mistakes

- No evidence of decision ownership.
- Not aligning to level expectations.

## The fix

1. Map expectations for the next level.
2. Collect examples showing scope and influence.
3. Document outcomes with metrics.
4. Build a clear promotion narrative.

## Proof hiring teams look for

- A level expectations map.
- 2–3 cross-team examples.
- Documented impact metrics.
