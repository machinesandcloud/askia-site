If you’re targeting DevOps & SRE, recruiter screens should make your impact obvious. This guide gives a clear plan to improve signal and decision clarity.

## Why this matters

Screens filter fast. You need clarity on scope and outcomes in minutes.

## Common mistakes

- Leading with job history instead of impact.
- Over-explaining without a clear headline.
- Missing the link to the target role.
- Not confirming level and scope early.

## The fix

1. Open with a 15-second impact summary.
2. Tie your experience to the target level.
3. Ask level and scope questions early.
4. Close with availability and next steps.

## Proof hiring teams look for

- A short opening summary.
- One outcome story with metrics.
- Clear level alignment.

## Context for fast offer cycles

Focus on the expectations that matter most in fast offer cycles. Tailor examples to the scope and pace that those roles demand.

## FAQ

**How long should my answer be?**

Start with 20–30 seconds, then expand if asked.

**Should I ask about comp?**

Ask about level and scope first; comp can follow if timing is right.

## Final takeaway

Clarity beats volume. Focus your story, prove impact, and iterate until the signal is obvious.
