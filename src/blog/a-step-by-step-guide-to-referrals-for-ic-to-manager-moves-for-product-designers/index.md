If you’re targeting product designers, referrals should make your impact obvious. This guide gives a clear plan to improve signal and decision clarity.

## Why this matters

Referrals reduce risk for hiring teams, but only when the ask is clear.

## Common mistakes

- Waiting too long to follow up.

## The fix

2. Provide a short impact summary.
3. Offer a 2–3 line intro they can forward.
4. Follow up with gratitude and updates.
