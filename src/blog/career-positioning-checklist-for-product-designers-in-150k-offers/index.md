If you’re targeting product designers, career positioning should make your impact obvious. This guide gives a clear plan to improve signal and decision clarity.

## Why this matters

Positioning decides which roles consider you. Clarity accelerates everything else.

2. Define the 2–3 outcomes you want to be known for.
3. Align resume, LinkedIn, and stories to that narrative.
4. Validate with recruiters or hiring managers.
