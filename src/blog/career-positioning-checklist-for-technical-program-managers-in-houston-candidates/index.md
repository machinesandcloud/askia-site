If you’re targeting technical program managers, career positioning should make your impact obvious. This guide gives a clear plan to improve signal and decision clarity.

## Why this matters

Positioning decides which roles consider you. Clarity accelerates everything else.

## Common mistakes

- Targeting multiple unrelated roles.
- Using vague role labels without scope.
- Missing a clear impact narrative.
- Not aligning proof to the target level.

## The fix

1. Choose one target role and level.
2. Define the 2–3 outcomes you want to be known for.
3. Align resume, LinkedIn, and stories to that narrative.
4. Validate with recruiters or hiring managers.

## Proof hiring teams look for

- A clear target statement.
- An impact narrative with metrics.
- Consistent messaging across materials.

## Context for Houston candidates

Focus on the expectations that matter most in Houston candidates. Tailor examples to the scope and pace that those roles demand.
## Local signal for Houston

Connect your outcomes to industries that hire heavily in Houston, such as energy, healthcare, logistics, and aerospace. Keep the reference natural and relevant.

## FAQ

**Can I target two roles?**

Only if they share the same core skills and level; otherwise focus on one.

**How do I know my positioning works?**

You should see better recruiter responses and stronger interview alignment.

## Final takeaway

Clarity beats volume. Focus your story, prove impact, and iterate until the signal is obvious.
