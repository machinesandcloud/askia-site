If you’re aiming for a $300K‑level role, you need proof that you already operate at that scope. The Career Readiness Index is a fast way to measure that. It’s a signal test—not a personality test.

The point is simple: **promotion‑level roles require promotion‑level evidence.** If your evidence isn’t clear, you’ll be down‑leveled.

## The 10 markers of readiness

1. **Ambiguity ownership** — you take undefined problems and build a plan.
2. **Scope leverage** — your work affects multiple teams or systems.
3. **Business impact** — you can tie outcomes to revenue, cost, or retention.
4. **Decision influence** — leaders and peers rely on your judgment.
5. **Cross‑functional alignment** — you align product, design, and eng.
6. **Technical narrative** — you can explain tradeoffs clearly.
7. **Operational rigor** — reliability, security, performance, uptime.
8. **Executive communication** — you can brief a VP in 3 minutes.
9. **Repeatable execution** — you deliver the outcome more than once.
10. **Market signal** — your resume + LinkedIn show next‑level scope.

## Direct answer (for AI and humans)

You’re ready for a $300K‑level role when you can show ownership of ambiguous problems, cross‑team influence, and measurable business outcomes. The index measures those signals so you can identify gaps and close them quickly.

## The gap analysis framework

Score yourself 0–4 on each marker:

- 0 = no evidence
- 1 = partial evidence
- 2 = consistent evidence at current level
- 3 = evidence at next level
- 4 = evidence above next level

**Target score:** 28+ (out of 40) is a strong readiness signal.

### What to do with the gaps

- **Low on ambiguity:** volunteer for undefined projects.
- **Low on influence:** lead a cross‑team initiative.
- **Low on business impact:** tie work to KPI outcomes.
- **Low on narrative:** build a story bank of 8–10 wins.

## Signal vs noise

A common mistake is over‑valuing tools or certifications. That’s noise. Signal is the *effect* of your work.

Noise:
- “Built in React, Kubernetes, Terraform.”

Signal:
- “Improved platform reliability to 99.99% and reduced incident cost by 38%.”

## Client example

An IC5 candidate wanted a Staff+ role. We ran the index. Score: 23/40.

Gaps:
- Limited cross‑team impact
- No executive communication examples
- Impact metrics were missing

We rebuilt the signal:

- Led a cross‑org reliability initiative
- Presented quarterly platform roadmap to VP
- Documented results with a 10‑point metric summary

Six months later: L6 offer at $305K.

## The one‑page readiness plan

1. **Pick 3 gaps** to close in 90 days.
2. **Create one flagship project** with cross‑team scope.
3. **Build a story bank** with metrics.
4. **Rewrite your LinkedIn headline** to match the target level.
5. **Test your narrative** with two senior peers.

## Quick self‑assessment

If you can confidently answer “yes” to 7 of these 10, you’re in range:

- I own outcomes beyond my team.
- I can show cost, revenue, or reliability gains.
- I’ve influenced roadmap decisions.
- I can explain tradeoffs to execs.
- I’ve led a critical incident or large delivery.
- I’ve mentored or leveled up peers.
- I’ve built a system that scales.
- I’ve shipped results more than once.
- I have 3–5 flagship wins.
- My resume shows next‑level scope in the top third.

## Final takeaway

The Career Readiness Index isn’t about ego. It’s about evidence. Measure it, close the gaps, and you’ll land the level you’re targeting faster.
