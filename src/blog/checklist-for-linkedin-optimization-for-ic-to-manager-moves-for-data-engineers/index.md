If you’re targeting data engineers, LinkedIn positioning should make your impact obvious. This guide gives a clear plan to improve signal and decision clarity.

## Why this matters

LinkedIn is often your first screen. A generic profile turns high-intent views into silent skips.

## Common mistakes

- Using a headline that repeats your title.
- Missing role-level keywords for your target roles.
- Describing work without outcomes.
- Leaving the About section vague or empty.

## The fix

1. Write a headline that combines role + impact + domain.
2. Update About to state target role, scope, and outcomes.
3. Add 3–5 bullets with measurable results in Experience.
4. Align keywords with the roles you want recruiters to find you for.

## Proof hiring teams look for

- A headline that maps to the target role.
- 2–3 quantified outcomes in Experience.
- A short About section that states level and scope.

## FAQ

**Do keywords still matter on LinkedIn?**

Yes. Recruiter search filters rely on them. Use role-level terms you want to be found for.

**How often should I update LinkedIn?**

Update after meaningful outcomes or role shifts; keep the top section current.

## Final takeaway

Clarity beats volume. Focus your story, prove impact, and iterate until the signal is obvious.
