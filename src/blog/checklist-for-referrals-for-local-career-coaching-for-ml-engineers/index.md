If you’re targeting ML engineers, referrals should make your impact obvious. This guide gives a clear plan to improve signal and decision clarity.

## Why this matters

Referrals reduce risk for hiring teams, but only when the ask is clear.

## Common mistakes

- Asking without context or target role.
- Making the intro hard to write.
- Not sharing proof of fit.
- Waiting too long to follow up.

## The fix

1. Share the exact role and level you want.
2. Provide a short impact summary.
3. Offer a 2–3 line intro they can forward.
4. Follow up with gratitude and updates.

## Proof hiring teams look for

- A short role target statement.
- One impact metric.
- A ready-to-forward intro.

## Context for local career coaching

Focus on the expectations that matter most in local career coaching. Tailor examples to the scope and pace that those roles demand.

## FAQ

**Who should I ask first?**

Start with people who know your work and can vouch for it.

**Should I offer anything in return?**

Offer to help them too, but keep the ask simple.

## Final takeaway

Clarity beats volume. Focus your story, prove impact, and iterate until the signal is obvious.
