If you want $280K+ comp, you need a defensible value narrative. Not just “I have 10 years.” You need **impact translation**: show how your work directly affects revenue, cost, or risk.

This is what hiring teams and recruiters are looking for. It’s not ego—it’s justification.

## Quick answer

To justify a high salary in tech, translate your work into business outcomes. Show scope, impact metrics, and the cost of not having your expertise. Then anchor your ask to the role’s expected value.

## The Impact Translation Model

Use this structure:

1. **What you owned** (scope)
2. **What changed** (impact)
3. **Why it mattered** (business outcome)

**Example:**

- Owned: reliability of payments platform
- Changed: reduced incident time by 41%
- Mattered: avoided $1.8M in annual chargebacks

That’s a comp defense.

## The 3 proof buckets

Hiring managers want at least one of these:

- **Revenue impact** (new revenue, upsell, expansion)
- **Cost reduction** (infra savings, efficiency)
- **Risk reduction** (stability, security, compliance)

If you have two, your leverage is strong. If you have all three, your leverage is premium.

## The narrative framework

When asked “What are your comp expectations?” respond with:

1. **Excitement**
2. **Scope alignment**
3. **Range with justification**

Example:

> “I’m excited about the scope here. Given the platform ownership and the impact I’ve driven in similar roles, I’m targeting total comp in the $280K–$320K range.”

## Case study: $245K → $295K

A candidate was offered $245K. We built a stronger value narrative:

- Quantified reliability impact: 99.95% → 99.99%
- Converted to business impact: $2.2M annual cost avoidance
- Positioned as a platform leader

Result: $295K total comp without a competing offer.

## The comp defense checklist

- [ ] 3 quantified outcomes
- [ ] 1 cross‑team initiative
- [ ] 1 risk reduction story
- [ ] Clear range tied to scope
- [ ] Confidence without arrogance

## The script that closes gaps

> “If base is capped, I’d love to explore sign‑on or equity to align with the impact I’m expected to deliver.”

## Final takeaway

You’re not asking for more money. You’re aligning comp to the value you deliver. Build the narrative, and the numbers follow.
