If you’re targeting QA / test automation, executive presence should make your impact obvious. This guide gives a clear plan to improve signal and decision clarity.

## Why this matters

Executive presence is about clarity and decision framing, not style.

## Common mistakes

- Overloading details instead of headlines.
- Not stating recommendations clearly.
- Avoiding tradeoffs and risks.
- No crisp summary.

## The fix

1. Lead with the headline and recommendation.
2. Explain tradeoffs in plain language.
3. Tie decisions to business outcomes.
4. Close with next steps and risks.

## Proof hiring teams look for

- A one-paragraph executive summary.
- Decision tradeoffs and outcomes.
- Clear next steps.

## Context for fast offer cycles
