If you’re targeting solutions architects, story bank should make your impact obvious. This guide gives a clear plan to improve signal and decision clarity.

## Why this matters

A story bank keeps you consistent across interviews, outreach, and negotiation.

## Common mistakes

- Only preparing one or two stories.
- Repeating stories that don’t match the prompt.
- Missing impact metrics.
- Not practicing delivery.

## The fix

1. Build 6–8 stories across scope, conflict, and growth.
2. Write a short version and a long version of each.
3. Practice with feedback.
4. Update stories after new wins.

## Proof hiring teams look for

- A written list of stories.
- One outcome metric per story.
- A short delivery outline.

## Context for high-signal interviews
