If you’re targeting tech professionals, resume clarity should make your impact obvious. This guide gives a clear plan to improve signal and decision clarity.

## Why this matters

Hiring teams scan for impact fast. If the story reads like tasks, senior signal gets lost.

## Common mistakes

- Leading with tools instead of outcomes.
- Mixing levels (IC vs. lead) without a clear scope.
- Using responsibilities instead of measurable impact.
- Burying the most relevant results below the fold.

## The fix

1. Define your target level and role focus in one sentence.
2. Choose 3 outcomes that best prove scope and impact.
3. Rewrite bullets to start with impact, then method, then tools.
4. Add a concise summary that matches the target role.

## Proof hiring teams look for

- A before/after bullet that shows impact shift.
- 1–2 metrics that align to the target role.
- A scope statement (team size, system size, or business impact).

## Local signal for Houston

Connect your outcomes to industries that hire heavily in Houston, such as energy, healthcare, logistics, and aerospace. Keep the reference natural and relevant.

## FAQ

**How long should a senior resume be?**

Usually 1–2 pages focused on impact and scope, not a full history.

**Should I tailor every resume?**

Yes. Tailor the top third to the target role and reuse proven impact bullets where they fit.

## Final takeaway

Clarity beats volume. Focus your story, prove impact, and iterate until the signal is obvious.
