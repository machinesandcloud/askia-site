If you’re targeting software engineers, job search strategy should make your impact obvious. This guide gives a clear plan to improve signal and decision clarity.

## Why this matters

A repeatable system beats random applications. Strategy creates momentum.

## Common mistakes

## The fix

3. Prepare role-specific stories before interviews.
4. Review pipeline metrics weekly and iterate.

## Proof hiring teams look for

- A target list with 20–30 roles.
