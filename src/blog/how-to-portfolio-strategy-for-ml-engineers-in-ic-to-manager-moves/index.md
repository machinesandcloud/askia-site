If you’re targeting ML engineers, portfolio strategy should make your impact obvious. This guide gives a clear plan to improve signal and decision clarity.

## Why this matters

Portfolios are impact evidence. Without measurable outcomes, they read junior.

## Common mistakes

- Including too many projects without impact.
- Showing process without results.
- Ignoring the target role’s scope.
- No clear narrative across projects.

## The fix

1. Choose 3–4 projects that match the target level.
2. Lead with outcomes, then show process.
3. Add metrics and decision context.
4. Summarize your role and scope clearly.

## Proof hiring teams look for

- Before/after outcomes.
- Scope statement per project.
- Decision tradeoffs you owned.
