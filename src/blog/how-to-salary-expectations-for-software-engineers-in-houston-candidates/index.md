If you’re targeting software engineers, salary expectations should make your impact obvious. This guide gives a clear plan to improve signal and decision clarity.

## Why this matters

Comp expectations shape the rest of the process. Clear ranges signal maturity.

## Common mistakes

- Using past salary as the only anchor.
- Giving a single number too early.
- Skipping the scope and level conversation.
- Ignoring total comp components.

## The fix

1. Research ranges for your level and market.
2. Frame expectations as a range tied to scope.
3. Ask about total comp and leveling early.
4. Adjust once you understand the full package.

## Proof hiring teams look for

- A target range with justification.
- Scope statement for the level you want.
- A note on total comp, not just base.

## Context for Houston candidates

Focus on the expectations that matter most in Houston candidates. Tailor examples to the scope and pace that those roles demand.
## Local signal for Houston
