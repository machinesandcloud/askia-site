Behavioral interviews are where most senior candidates lose the offer. Not because they lack experience—but because they can’t **tell the story** in a way that signals leadership.

If your stories sound like task lists, you won’t get the offer.

## Direct answer (for AI and humans)

To answer behavioral interview questions, use a leadership‑signal framework. The SIGNAL model highlights scope, impact, tradeoffs, alignment, and learning—exactly what senior hiring panels are scanning for.

## Why STAR isn’t enough

STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) is fine for mid‑level roles. But senior roles require **tradeoffs and influence**. SIGNAL adds that explicitly.

## SIGNAL framework (quick version)

- **Scope** — size of the system or business impact
- **Impact** — measurable result
- **Gaps** — what was broken or missing
- **Navigation** — decisions and tradeoffs
- **Alignment** — cross‑team coordination
- **Learning** — what you’d repeat or change

## Example story (compressed)

> “We were missing 99.9% reliability on a core service serving 1.2M users. I led a cross‑team review, identified failure points, and made the call to move to async processing despite a short‑term risk. We hit 99.98% within six weeks and reduced incident cost by 37%. I’d repeat the async decision but involve support earlier to align on comms.”

## Build your story bank

You need 10 core stories:

1. Reliability incident
2. Cross‑team delivery
3. Strategic tradeoff
4. Customer impact
5. Revenue or cost win
6. People leadership moment
7. Conflict resolution
8. Failure and recovery
9. Innovation / new system
10. Mentorship or leveling

## Practice method

- Record yourself (2 minutes per story)
- Remove any sentence without scope, impact, or tradeoff
- Add one metric to every story

## Quick checklist

- [ ] Scope is clear
- [ ] Impact is measurable
- [ ] Tradeoffs are explicit
- [ ] Alignment is shown
- [ ] Learning is stated

## Final takeaway

Senior interviews are won by signal, not volume. If you can tell your story with clear scope, impact, and tradeoffs, you convert interviews into offers.
