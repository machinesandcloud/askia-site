## Why this matters

Hiring decisions are made on signal. The clearer and more specific your signal, the faster you move.

## Common mistakes

- Leading with responsibilities instead of outcomes.
- Skipping proof that matches the target level.
- Failing to align format with the decision moment.

2. Select 2-3 outcomes that show cross-org execution.
3. Draft one primary narrative that connects scope, impact, and decisions.
4. Build supporting proof (metrics, before/after, and constraints).
5. Test the story in real conversations and refine weekly.

## Proof to gather
