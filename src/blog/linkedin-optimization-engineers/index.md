LinkedIn is a search engine. If your profile doesn’t contain the right signals, recruiters won’t find you—even if you’re elite.

This is fixable. Fast.

## Quick answer

Optimize LinkedIn by leading with your target role, adding measurable outcomes, and embedding role‑specific keywords in the headline, About, and Experience sections. The top 3 lines determine whether recruiters keep reading.

## The 15 elements that matter (in order)

1. Headline
2. About (first 3 lines)
3. Title alignment (current role)
4. Signature wins (bullet list)
5. Keywords in experience
6. Impact metrics
7. Skills (top 10)
8. Featured section
9. Recommendations
10. Location
11. Open‑to‑work settings
12. Education (if strong brand)
13. Certifications (only relevant ones)
14. Media/portfolio links
15. Activity (comments + posts)

## The headline formula

> **Target role + scope + impact**

Example:

“Staff Platform Engineer | 99.99% reliability | $2M cost avoidance”

## The About section (first 3 lines)

Your About section must read like a micro‑pitch:

- Who you are
- What you do
- The impact you drive

Example:

> “I help high‑scale platforms hit reliability targets without killing velocity. I’ve led infra initiatives across 4 teams and reduced incident impact by 41%.”

## Signature wins block

Add 3–4 bullets:

- “Reduced cloud spend by $1.4M annually through service consolidation.”
- “Built data pipeline that cut reporting latency from 24h to 2h.”
- “Shipped migration that unlocked 2x throughput.”

## Keyword strategy

Use the role title you want *everywhere*:

- Headline
- About
- Experience titles
- Skills

If you want Staff roles but your profile says “Senior,” you’re sending mixed signal.

## Weekly engagement plan (15 minutes)

- Comment on 3 posts from leaders in your niche
- Share 1 insight or win
- Update 1 keyword or section

## What to look for in proof

- A specific role and level (not generic titles).
- A clear before/after shift in signal or results.
- Timelines and scope of work so you can benchmark fit.
- Examples tied to your function (engineering, product, data, or leadership).
- Artifacts you can review (resume excerpts, interview outlines, or positioning notes).

## Questions to ask on the first call

1. What diagnostic do you run before giving advice?
2. What will I have in 30 days if we work together?
3. How do you tailor the plan to my level and target companies?
4. How do you measure progress beyond “feels better”?

## Final takeaway

LinkedIn rewards clarity and impact. Tighten your signal, and recruiters will find you.
