If you’re targeting data engineers, cold outreach should make your impact obvious. This guide gives a clear plan to improve signal and decision clarity.

## Why this matters

Cold outreach works when it’s specific, relevant, and easy to respond to.

## Common mistakes

- Asking for too much upfront.
- No proof of relevance.
- Failing to follow up.

## The fix

1. Start with a relevant hook tied to their team or product.
2. State your impact in one line.
3. Make a small, clear ask.
4. Follow up with value, not pressure.

## Proof hiring teams look for

- A 2–3 sentence message.
- One outcome metric.
- A specific ask and timeline.

## Context for competitive markets
