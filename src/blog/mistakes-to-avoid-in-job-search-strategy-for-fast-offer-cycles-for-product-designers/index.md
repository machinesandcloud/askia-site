If you’re targeting product designers, job search strategy should make your impact obvious. This guide gives a clear plan to improve signal and decision clarity.

## Why this matters

A repeatable system beats random applications. Strategy creates momentum.

## Common mistakes

- Applying broadly without targeting.
- Not tracking responses or pipeline stages.
- Ignoring warm introductions and referrals.
- Letting outreach and prep drift.

## The fix

1. Build a focused target list of companies and roles.
2. Create weekly outreach and follow-up targets.
3. Prepare role-specific stories before interviews.
4. Review pipeline metrics weekly and iterate.

## Proof hiring teams look for

- A target list with 20–30 roles.
- Weekly outreach log.
- Interview readiness checklist.
