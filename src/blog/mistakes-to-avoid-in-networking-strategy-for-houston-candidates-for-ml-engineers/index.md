If you’re targeting ML engineers, networking strategy should make your impact obvious. This guide gives a clear plan to improve signal and decision clarity.

## Why this matters

Warm connections drive faster interviews. Strategy turns networking into outcomes.

## Common mistakes

- Reaching out without a specific reason.
- Only messaging when you need something.
- Not following up.
- No target list.

## The fix

1. Build a small list of target companies and roles.
2. Reach out with a specific, relevant ask.
3. Share a short value narrative.
4. Follow up with updates and gratitude.

## Proof hiring teams look for

- A short target list.
- A 2–3 line outreach message.
- A follow-up plan.

## Context for Houston candidates

Focus on the expectations that matter most in Houston candidates. Tailor examples to the scope and pace that those roles demand.
## Local signal for Houston

Connect your outcomes to industries that hire heavily in Houston, such as energy, healthcare, logistics, and aerospace. Keep the reference natural and relevant.
