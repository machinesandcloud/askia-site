If you’re targeting ML engineers, offer negotiation should make your impact obvious. This guide gives a clear plan to improve signal and decision clarity.

## Why this matters

Offers are decided on leverage and clarity. A solid strategy protects long-term value.

## Common mistakes

- Sharing a number before understanding the full package.
- Negotiating base without considering equity and bonuses.
- Failing to tie your ask to market data and impact.
- Rushing a decision without a plan.

## The fix

1. Clarify the full package and decision timeline.
2. Anchor your value with outcomes and market ranges.
3. Make a specific, justified ask.
4. Use timing and competing offers to manage leverage.

## Proof hiring teams look for

- A short value narrative tied to outcomes.
- Market data for the target level.
- A clear ask with justification.
