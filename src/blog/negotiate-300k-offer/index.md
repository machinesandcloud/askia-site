Senior negotiations fail when they sound like demands. The best counters are calm, specific, and tied to impact.

## Quick answer

Anchor your ask on scope, counter with a clear range, and trade across equity and sign-on if base is capped. Keep the tone collaborative and confident.

## Why this matters

At senior levels, hiring decisions are driven by risk reduction. Clear signal reduces risk. When your story is precise, the process moves faster.

## Framework

- Confirm excitement and fit.
- Anchor to scope and impact.
- Counter with a clear range.
- Trade across equity or sign-on.

## Common mistakes

- Using vague language like 'something higher'.
- Adding too many numbers.
- Negotiating before confirming role fit.

## Action checklist

- [ ] Impact narrative prepared.
- [ ] Target range defined.
- [ ] Alternative levers identified.
- [ ] Timeline agreed.


## Pros and cons

Pros:
- Faster decision-making when your scope and impact are explicit.
- Higher conversion from readers who see proof, not just promises.
- More referrals from clear outcomes and repeatable frameworks.

Cons:
- Requires disciplined documentation of outcomes.
- Takes consistent updates to keep proof current.
- Demands a tighter narrative across resume, LinkedIn, and interviews.

## Metrics to track

- Time from first contact to interview loop
- Callback rate from target roles
- Offer rate per interview loop
- Average comp uplift after negotiation

## Final takeaway

Clarity beats volume. Build signal, align to scope, and make your impact unmistakable.
