Moving into management is a career multiplier—if you do it at the right time. The mistake is switching before you’ve built leadership signal. That can stall your growth fast.

## Quick answer

To transition from IC to EM, build leadership signal first: mentorship, cross‑team delivery, and ownership of ambiguous problems. Then make the move with a clear narrative about why management fits your impact style.

## The readiness test (3 questions)

1. Have you led a cross‑team initiative?
2. Have you mentored or leveled up other engineers?
3. Can you articulate a delivery strategy beyond your own code?

If you can’t answer yes to two of these, build signal first.

## The leadership signal ladder

- **Mentorship** → you grow other people
- **Delivery ownership** → you own outcomes
- **Cross‑team alignment** → you lead without authority
- **Strategy** → you shape the roadmap

## Case study: IC4 → EM1 at $245K

An IC4 wanted management but was stuck in execution. We built leadership signal:

- Led a cross‑team migration
- Mentored 3 juniors
- Built a quarterly roadmap deck

Six months later: EM1 offer at $245K.

## The management narrative (what to say)

> “I’m moving toward management because I want to multiply impact through people and systems. I’ve already led cross‑team delivery and mentorship, and I’m ready to own team outcomes.”

## The alternative path

If you love deep technical work, Staff+ IC roles may offer equal comp and more autonomy. Management isn’t the only path to senior compensation.

## What to look for in proof

- A specific role and level (not generic titles).
- A clear before/after shift in signal or results.
- Timelines and scope of work so you can benchmark fit.
- Examples tied to your function (engineering, product, data, or leadership).
- Artifacts you can review (resume excerpts, interview outlines, or positioning notes).

## Questions to ask on the first call

1. What diagnostic do you run before giving advice?
2. What will I have in 30 days if we work together?
3. How do you tailor the plan to my level and target companies?
4. How do you measure progress beyond “feels better”?

## Final takeaway

Management isn’t about title. It’s about signal. Build it first, and your pivot becomes leverage instead of risk.
