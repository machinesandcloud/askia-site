Technical Screen should make your value obvious in under 10 seconds. This guide focuses on how to avoid generic positioning without inflating claims.

## Quick answer

Lead with scope, quantify outcomes, and make the level fit unmistakable. If your technical screen does not show impact, the loop stalls.

## Why this matters

Senior hiring is about risk reduction. Clarity and proof reduce perceived risk and move decisions forward.

## The framework

1. Define the target level in one line.
2. Surface three outcomes (e.g., 24% improvement, 9x faster).
3. Align resume, LinkedIn, and interview stories to the same wins.
4. Translate tools into business outcomes.
5. Pressure-test the narrative with a senior peer.

## Pros and cons

Pros:
- Faster decision making.
- Higher conversion from proof-led content.

Cons:
- Requires consistent documentation.
- Takes narrative discipline.

## Metrics to track

- Callback rate from target roles
- Offer rate per loop
- Time to offer

## What to look for in proof

- A specific role and level (not generic titles).
- A clear before/after shift in signal or results.
- Timelines and scope of work so you can benchmark fit.
- Examples tied to your function (engineering, product, data, or leadership).
- Artifacts you can review (resume excerpts, interview outlines, or positioning notes).

## Questions to ask on the first call

1. What diagnostic do you run before giving advice?
2. What will I have in 30 days if we work together?
3. How do you tailor the plan to my level and target companies?
4. How do you measure progress beyond “feels better”?

## Final takeaway

Clarity beats volume. Build signal, align it across channels, and your results compound fast.
