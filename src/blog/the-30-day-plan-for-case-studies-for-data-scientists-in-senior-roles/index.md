If you’re targeting data scientists, case studies should make your impact obvious. This guide gives a clear plan to improve signal and decision clarity.

## Why this matters

Case studies are proof. Without context and outcomes, they look like busywork.

## Common mistakes

- Skipping business context.
- Describing tasks instead of decisions.
- No measurable result.
- Overloading with detail.

## The fix

1. Start with the problem and why it mattered.
2. Explain the decision and constraints.
3. Show the outcome with metrics.
4. Close with lessons and impact.

## Proof hiring teams look for

- A one-paragraph summary.
- Key metrics and scope.
- Decision tradeoffs.

## Context for senior roles

Focus on the expectations that matter most in senior roles. Tailor examples to the scope and pace that those roles demand.

## FAQ

**How long should a case study be?**

Short enough to scan, long enough to show impact.

**Do I need visuals?**

Only if they clarify the outcome or decision.

## Final takeaway

Clarity beats volume. Focus your story, prove impact, and iterate until the signal is obvious.
