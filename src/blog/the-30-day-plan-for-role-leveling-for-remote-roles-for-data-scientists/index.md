If you’re targeting data scientists, role leveling should make your impact obvious. This guide gives a clear plan to improve signal and decision clarity.

## Why this matters

Wrong level targets slow everything down. Leveling clarity speeds alignment.

## Common mistakes

- Applying at multiple levels without a core narrative.
- Ignoring scope expectations for the target level.
- Underselling leadership or ownership.
- Overstating impact without proof.

## The fix

1. Map the scope for your target level.
2. Align your stories to that scope.
3. Update resume and LinkedIn to match.
4. Validate with recruiters or peers.

## Proof hiring teams look for

- Scope statement for the target level.
- Impact metrics that match scope.
- Consistent narrative across channels.

## Context for remote roles
