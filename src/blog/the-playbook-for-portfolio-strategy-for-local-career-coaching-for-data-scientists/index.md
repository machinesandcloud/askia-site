If you’re targeting data scientists, portfolio strategy should make your impact obvious. This guide gives a clear plan to improve signal and decision clarity.

## Why this matters

Portfolios are impact evidence. Without measurable outcomes, they read junior.

## Common mistakes

- Including too many projects without impact.
- Showing process without results.
- Ignoring the target role’s scope.
- No clear narrative across projects.

## The fix

1. Choose 3–4 projects that match the target level.
2. Lead with outcomes, then show process.
3. Add metrics and decision context.
4. Summarize your role and scope clearly.

## Proof hiring teams look for

- Before/after outcomes.
- Scope statement per project.
- Decision tradeoffs you owned.

## Context for local career coaching

Focus on the expectations that matter most in local career coaching. Tailor examples to the scope and pace that those roles demand.

## FAQ

**How many projects should I show?**

3–4 strong ones beat a long list.

**Should I include wireframes?**

Yes if they support decisions and outcomes, not as filler.

## Final takeaway

Clarity beats volume. Focus your story, prove impact, and iterate until the signal is obvious.
