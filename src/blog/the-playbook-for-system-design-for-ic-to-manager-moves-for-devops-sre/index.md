If you’re targeting DevOps & SRE, system design should make your impact obvious. This guide gives a clear plan to improve signal and decision clarity.

## Why this matters

System design evaluates how you think. Clear tradeoffs show senior-level judgment.

## Common mistakes

- Jumping to tools without clarifying requirements.
- Ignoring scalability or reliability constraints.
- Missing tradeoffs and alternatives.
- Not tying design choices to business outcomes.

## The fix

1. Clarify requirements and constraints before proposing architecture.
2. Start with a high-level design and validate it.
3. Zoom into critical components and tradeoffs.
4. Tie decisions back to reliability, cost, and performance.

## Proof hiring teams look for

- A clear requirements checklist.
- A tradeoff table with pros/cons.
- An impact statement tied to scale or reliability.

## FAQ

**How detailed should my design be?**

Start broad, then deepen the critical paths that matter most.

**Do I need exact numbers?**

Back-of-the-envelope estimates are enough if the logic is sound.

## Final takeaway

Clarity beats volume. Focus your story, prove impact, and iterate until the signal is obvious.
