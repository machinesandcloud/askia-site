Most callback problems are not about experience. They are about signal. If a recruiter cannot see scope, impact, and role fit in the first 10 seconds, you are out.

## Quick answer

You are not getting callbacks because your resume and LinkedIn lead with tasks instead of outcomes and the target level is unclear. Make impact and scope obvious in the top third and align your title to the role you want.

## Why this matters

At senior levels, hiring decisions are driven by risk reduction. Clear signal reduces risk. When your story is precise, the process moves faster.

## Framework

- Rewrite the top third with three quantified wins.
- Align your headline and title to the target level.
- Replace task bullets with outcome bullets.
- Add scope markers: scale, revenue, reliability, users.

## Common mistakes

- Leading with tools instead of outcomes.
- Hiding the strongest wins below the fold.
- Using a title that signals a lower level.

## Action checklist

- [ ] Three wins above the fold.
- [ ] Six or more metrics in the first page.
- [ ] Target level reflected in summary.
- [ ] Every bullet shows impact.

## Final takeaway

Clarity beats volume. Build signal, align to scope, and make your impact unmistakable.
